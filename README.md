Krean letters. Korean (Hangukmal) consonant and vowel letters practice sheet.

Hello folks

If you want to practice all korean letters by writing, I hope this sheet helps.
Vertically consonant and horizontally vowel letters are placed, so you can practice by combining them.

Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_MLhPqmbsDo4e9jpdodbdDSPzCMlbXvb-J2SFkiIk6k/edit?usp=sharing) to actual google spread sheet, so you can do your customization as you wish.
